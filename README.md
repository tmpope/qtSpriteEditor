# qtSpriteEditor

*by Obey Your Thirst*

Sprite Editor application powered by Qt for CS3505.

## Required Requirements

These are requirements that we are required to include in our application:

* Set the size of the sprite in pixels
* Set and adjust the number of frames in the sprite
* Allow the user to modify the pixels of the sprite (to draw the thing)
* Provide a preview of the sprite animation cycle
* Save and load various projects using the file format defined in class - .ssp

## Extra Requirements

The following is a tentative list of the various requirements that we will promise our end user:

* Onion skin slider that shows a transparent version of the previous sprite onto the current frame
* Ability to export the project into a .gif file
* A collection of extra tools:
    * Eraser
    * Select and Move & copy and paste commands
    * Eyedropper
    * Clone onto all frames
    * Undo/Redo
    * Rotate frame 90/180/270 degrees - potentially with the select and move tool
